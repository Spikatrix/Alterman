# Alterman

Platformer with an underworld. Game submission for the [September 2020 libGDX Jam](https://itch.io/jam/libgdx-jam-september-2020). 
Code is pretty bad as it was done in a hurry.

# Build

    $ git clone https://github.com/Spikatrix/Alterman
    $ cd Alterman
    $ ./gradlew lwjgl3:assembleDist   // Desktop
